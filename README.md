# Microsoft FrontPage 98 Wine Guide Template
Back in 1997 I had this idea to build a web site around wine and the wine industry, I think this is as far as I got using Microsoft FrontPage 98 WYSIWYG HTML editor.

I don't think I got much further then this and as I found these files I thought I would put them up here for "historical" purposes.

The idea of the design was that it was going to go up on a Geocities site. Though knowing how specific Microsoft FrontPage was in requiring a Microsoft Web Server and Internet Explorer, I am sure it would have taken a lot of work at the time to get it "presentable" on anything other then the Microsoft Universe.

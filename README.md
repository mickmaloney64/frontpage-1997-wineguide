# Microsoft FrontPage Wine Guide Template
Back in 1997 I had this idea to build a web site around wine and the wine industry, I think this is as far as I got using Micosoft FrontPage 98 WYSIWYG HTML editor.

I don't think I got much further then this and as I found these files I thought I would put them up here for "historical" purposes.
